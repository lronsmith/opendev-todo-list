# React + Vite

The React application was created using the following command

```shell
npm create vite@latest
```

This version of the todoList is a frontend and backend version. The point of this version is to highlight how a backend allows multiple people to access the same todolist on different devices, and allows the user to refresh their page and keep their todos without having to store cookies.

However, when the backend is restarted all the todos are lost.
