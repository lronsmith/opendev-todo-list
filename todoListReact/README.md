# React + Vite

This React application was created using the following command

```shell
npm create vite@latest
```

This version of the todoList is a frontend only version. The point of this version is to highlight how a frontend only application is only seen by one person, (I can't send a link to a friend for them to see my to do list with all the todos in it).

Additionally, when cookies aren't used, the todolist is lost whenever the use refreshes their page.
